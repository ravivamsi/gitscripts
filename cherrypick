Incase someone force push the code and you are struck with your changes being pushed:

Get the sha1 number for the commit that needs to be cherry pick : <copy the sha1code here>

// Rename the current branch which has the changes to <source-branchname>
git branch -m <source-branchname>

// Checkout the existing branch name 
git checkout <branchname>

// Cherry pick the sha1 required
git cherry-pick <sha1code>

// Check the log for the new cherry pick commit
git log

// Check-in the changes
git push origin <branchname>
