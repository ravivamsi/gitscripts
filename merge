// You are trying to merge a branch "A-source" into branch "B-destination"
// Assuming you have the git repository cloned into your workspace
// Assuming you have commits in the A-source which are not present in the B-destination

// Checkout the B-destination branch
git checkout B-destination

// Once you are on the B-destination branch
git merge A-source

// If you don't have any merge conflicts, it is a fast farword merge 
git push origin B-destination

// If you have conflicts in the files, you will have to resolve them manually 
Ex:
<<<<<<<HEAD

Changes here are from the A-source branch

=======

Code here is from the B-destination branch(your changes)

>>>>>>>branchname


// Get the latest changes of your code remove the code which is not required
// Remove the <<<<<<<<<
// Remove the ========
// Remove the >>>>>>>>> also

// Check the status 
git status

//Add the files to the stage if required

// To add all files
git add .
// To add a particular file
git add <filename>

// Commit your changes
git commit -m "Commit message"

// Push your changes to the remote origin of the branch
git push origin B-destination
